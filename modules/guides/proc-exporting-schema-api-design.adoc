[role="_abstract"]
When you're happy with your changes to an {product-long-api-designer} event schema or API definition, and you want to use the design in your application, you can export the content to an existing {product-long-registry} instance.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-api-designer} web console at {service-url-api-designer}[^].
* You've created or imported an {product-api-designer} design.
* You can access a running {product-registry} instance in your organization.

.Procedure
. In the *{product-api-designer}* designs page of the web console, select the {product-api-designer} design that you want to export.
. Click *Edit* to open the design editor.
. From the *Actions* menu, click *Export to {registry}*.
. Complete the form to specify where the new design should be saved.
+
NOTE: If the design was originally imported from {product-registry}, the fields are prepopulated with the details of the original {product-registry} instance, and the *Version* is incremented.
+
.. *Registry instance*: Select the required instance from the list.
.. *Group*: Enter an optional unique group name such as `my-org` to organize the artifact in a named collection. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization.
+
NOTE:  Specifying a group is optional when using the web console: {registry} generates a `default` group automatically.
+
.. *Artifact ID*: Enter an optional unique ID for this artifact, such as `my-ID`. If you don't specify a unique artifact ID, {registry} generates one automatically as a UUID.
.. *Version*: Specify the version number.

. Click *Export*.

You can manage {product-long-api-designer} design versions in {product-long-registry}. You can also download {product-api-designer} designs to a file, either for local client code generation or to import the designs into {product-long-api-management}.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the design listed as an artifact in {product-long-registry}?
* Are the artifact details correct?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the design is listed as an artifact in {product-long-registry}.
* Verify that the artifact details are correct.
