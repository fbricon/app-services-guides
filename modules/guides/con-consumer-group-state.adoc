= Consumer group states
:imagesdir: ../_images
Consumer group states displayed in the OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka web console and `rhoas` CLI can be one of the following values:

* *Empty*: The group exists but has no members.
* *Stable*: Rebalancing already occurred and consumers are consuming.
* *PreparingRebalance*: The group is waiting for consumers to join, which requires the reassignment of partitions, so the Kafka instance is currently rebalancing.
* *CompletingRebalance*: The Kafka instance is still rebalancing and reassigning partitions.
* *Dead*: The group is due to be removed from this Kafka instance soon. This deletion might be due to inactivity, or the group is being migrated to a different group coordinator.
* *Unknown*: The state is too new for it to be parsed.
