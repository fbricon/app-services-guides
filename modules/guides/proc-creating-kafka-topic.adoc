= Creating a Kafka topic in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your applications and services.

.Prerequisites
* You have a running Kafka instance in {product-long-kafka}.

.Procedure

. In the {product-long-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], select *Kafka Instances* and then click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Select the *Topics* tab.
. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the topic details, as shown in the figure.

You must specify the following topic properties:

* *Topic name*: Enter a unique topic name, such as `my-first-kafka-topic`.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partitions value to `1`. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time and size to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention time to `A week` and the retention size to `Unlimited`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy. Retention size is the maximum total size of all log segments in a partition before they are deleted or compacted.
* *Replicas*: Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. For this release of {product-kafka}, the replica values are preconfigured. For a standard Kafka instance, the number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. For a trial Kafka instance, the number of replicas and the minimum in-sync replica factor are both set to `1`. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.

After you complete the topic setup, the new topic is listed on the *Topics* page. You can now start producing and consuming messages to and from this topic using applications that you connect to the Kafka instance.

NOTE: If you try to create a topic with a number of partitions that would cause the partition limit of the Kafka instance to be exceeded, you see an error message indicating this. For more information about partition limits for Kafka instances, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[{product-long-kafka} service limits].
endif::[]

NOTE: If the topic creation is unsuccessful and you see a `400 Bad Request` error message, try to create your topic again later. This situation might occur, for example, if your selected cloud provider has a temporary availability problem that affects your Kafka instance.

. (Optional) To edit or delete the topic, click the options icon (three vertical dots) next to the topic name, as shown in the figure.
