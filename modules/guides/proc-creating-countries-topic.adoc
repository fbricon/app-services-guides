= Creating a Kafka topic in {product-kafka}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
The Node.js application in this quick start uses a Kafka topic called `countries` to produce and consume messages. In this task, you'll create the topic in your Kafka instance.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance in {product-long-kafka} and the instance is in the *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} web console, select *Kafka Instances* and then click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Select the *Topics* tab.
. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the topic details, as shown in the figure.

You must specify the following topic properties:

* *Topic name*: Enter `countries` as the topic name.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partition to `1` for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time and size to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention time to `7 days` and the retention size to `Unlimited`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy. Retention size is the maximum total size of all log segments in a partition before they are deleted or compacted.
* *Replicas*: For this release of {product-kafka}, the replicas are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.

After you complete the setup, the new topic appears on the *Topics* page. You can now run the Node.js application to start producing and consuming messages.
