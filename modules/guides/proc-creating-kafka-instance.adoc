= Creating a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-long-kafka} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services. A Kafka instance in {product-kafka} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configuration details needed for producers and consumers to connect to the instance.

ifndef::qs[]
.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-kafka} web console at {service-url-kafka}[^].
* You're familiar with the different Kafka instance sizes that you can create in {product-kafka}, and the capacities that correspond to those sizes. For more information about the capacities and service limits of your Kafka instance, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka Service Limits].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], select *Kafka Instances* and click *Create Kafka instance*.
+
The instance creation pane opens, as shown in the figure.

. Enter a unique name for the Kafka instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
. In the *Cloud region* list, select the relevant option.
+
NOTE: The cloud provider is preconfigured to the same value for both trial and production instances. The availability zone value is preconfigured as *Single* for a trial instance and *Multi* for a production instance.
+
////
//For post preview, when more options are available.
. In the *Streams for Apache Kafka* page of the web console, click *Create Kafka instance* and define the following instance details. Some values currently have only one option.
* *Instance name*: Enter a unique name for the instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
* *Cloud provider*: Select `Amazon Web Services`.
* *Cloud region*: Select `US East, N. Virginia`.
* *Availability zones*: Select `Multi`.
////
. If you've purchased a subscription for {product-kafka}, use the slider to select an instance size. Instances with more streaming units have more capacity. If you're creating a trial instance, the instance size is preconfigured.
+
NOTE: In {product-kafka}, you can create Kafka instances of 1 or 2 streaming units. Instances larger than 1 streaming unit are currently available as a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.


. Click *Create instance* to start the creation process for your Kafka instance.
+
--
The new Kafka instance is listed on the *Kafka Instances* page. Typically, you need to wait a few minutes for the instance creation process to finish.

When the instance has a status of *Ready*, you can start using the instance. As shown in the following figure, you can click the options icon (three vertical dots) to view instance and connection details, change the instance owner, or delete the instance.

NOTE: Although you can see Kafka instances created by other users in your organization, you might not be able to manage or connect to those instances. Only the instance owner or users with permissions to access the instance can edit or delete the instance, access the associated service account and topics, or connect to the instance.

* Is the status of the new Kafka instance shown as *Ready*?
