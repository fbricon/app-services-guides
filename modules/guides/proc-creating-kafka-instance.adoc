= Creating a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-kafka} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services. A Kafka instance in {product-kafka} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configurations needed for producers and consumers to connect to the instance.

ifndef::qs[]
.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-kafka} web console at {service-url-kafka}[^].
* You're familiar with the different Kafka instance sizes that you can create in {product-kafka}, and the capacities that correspond to those sizes. For more information about the capacities and service limits of your Kafka instance, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka Service Limits].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click *Create Kafka instance*.
. Enter a unique name for the Kafka instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
. From the *Cloud region* drop-down menu, select the relevant option. The selection for availability zones is preconfigured as *Single* for a trial instance and *Multi* for a production instance.
+
NOTE: The cloud provider is preconfigured.
+
////
//For post preview, when more options are available.
. In the *Streams for Apache Kafka* page of the web console, click *Create Kafka instance* and define the following instance details. Some values currently have only one option.
* *Instance name*: Enter a unique name for the instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
* *Cloud provider*: Select `Amazon Web Services`.
* *Cloud region*: Select `US East, N. Virginia`.
* *Availability zones*: Select `Multi`.
////
. If you've purchased a subscription for {product-kafka}, use the slider to select an instance size. Instances with more streaming units have more capacity. If you're creating a trial instance, the instance size is preconfigured.
+
NOTE: In {product-kafka}, you can create Kafka instances of 1 or 2 streaming units. Instances larger than 1 streaming unit are currently available as a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.


. Click *Create instance* to start the creation process for your Kafka instance.

The new Kafka instance is listed in the instances table. Typically, you need to wait a few minutes for the instance creation process to finish.

When the instance *Status* is *Ready*, you can start using the Kafka instance. You can use the options icon (three vertical dots) to view instance details, connect to the instance, change the instance owner, or delete the instance.

NOTE: Although you can see Kafka instances created by other users in your organization, you might not be able to manage or connect to those instances. Only the instance owner or users with permissions to access the instance can edit or delete the instance, access the associated service account and topics, or connect to the instance.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the new Kafka instance listed in the instances table?
* Is the state of the new Kafka instance shown as *Ready*?

// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

The center of the page shows you the list of Kafka instances that are currently running within your organisation. If this is your, or your organisations, first interaction with {Product_short}, this list will be empty.
