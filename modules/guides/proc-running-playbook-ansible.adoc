When you have finished creating the resources, run the playbook.

.Procedure

. Save any changes you have made to the the example `rhoas_test` playbook.
. Open a terminal and enter the following command to run the playbook:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook rhoas_kafka.yml
----
+
The playbook runs through the tasks sequentially, generating output in the terminal window. When finished, Ansible displays a `PLAY RECAP` message stating that all 8 tasks have an `ok` status, meaning they have all run successfully.
