= Listing consumer groups
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
In addition to the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], you can use the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) or the Kafka `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` script to list consumer groups for your Kafka instance. The following subsections describe how to use these methods to list consumer groups.

NOTE: The Kafka scripts are part of the open source community version of Apache Kafka. The scripts are not a part of {product-kafka} and are therefore not supported by Red Hat.
