[role="_abstract"]
To delete a service account, use the `delete_service_account_by_id` module.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a service account.

.Procedure

. To delete the service account, copy the `delete_service_account_by_id` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
. To directly specify a service account ID, enter a value in the `service_account_id` field. Otherwise, Ansible gets the service account ID from the `srvce_acc_resp_obj` variable.
