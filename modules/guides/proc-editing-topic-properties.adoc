= Reviewing and editing topic properties in {product-kafka}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-long-kafka} web console to select a topic in your Kafka instance and review the topic properties. You can adjust the editable topic properties as needed.

As an alternative to using the {product-kafka} web console, you can use the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) to update certain topic properties, as shown in the following example command:

.Example CLI command to update topic retention time
[source]
----
rhoas kafka topic update --name my-kafka-topic --retention-ms 704800000
----

For a list of topic properties that you can update using the CLI, see the `rhoas kafka topic update` entry in the {base-url-cli}{command-ref-url-cli}[CLI command reference (rhoas)^].

.Prerequisites
* You have created a Kafka instance with at least one Kafka topic in {product-kafka}. To learn how to do this, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-kafka}[Getting started with {product-long-kafka}^].

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], click *Kafka Instances* and select the Kafka instance that contains the topic you want to configure.
. Select the *Topics* tab.
. Select the options icon (three vertical dots) for the relevant topic and click *Edit* to review the current topic properties, and adjust any editable topic properties as needed.
. Click *Save* to finish.

NOTE: You can also edit topic properties by selecting the *Properties* tab within the topic.
