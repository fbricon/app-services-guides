You can use the `kafka-console-consumer` script to consume messages from Kafka topics. This example consumes the messages that you sent previously with the producer that you created with the `kafka-console-producer` script.

.Prerequisites

* You used the `kafka-console-producer` script to produce example messages to a topic.

.Procedure
. Open a second terminal window or tab, separate from the producer.

. On the command line, enter the following command to start the `kafka-console-consumer` script.

.Starting the `kafka-console-consumer` script

$ ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-other-topic --bootstrap-server "__<bootstrap_server>__" --from-beginning --consumer.config ../config/{property-file-name}
First message
Second message
Third message
----
--
The preceding example uses the SASL/PLAIN authentication mechanism with the credentials that you saved in the `{property-file-name}` file. This example consumes and displays the messages from the `my-other-topic` example topic.

. If your producer is still running in a separate terminal, continue entering messages in the producer terminal and observe the messages being consumed in the consumer terminal.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the `kafka-console-consumer` script running without any errors in the terminal?
* Did the `kafka-console-consumer` script display the messages from the `my-other-topic` example topic?
