[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can connect applications on a Kubernetes platform such as Red Hat OpenShift to cloud services such as {product-long-kafka} and {product-long-registry}.

For example, suppose you have the following applications deployed on OpenShift:

* One application that publishes price updates for a variety of stocks
* A second application that consumes the price updates for publication on a web page

In addition, suppose you have a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}. Each time the first application produces a price update, you want to use the Kafka instance to forward the update as an event to the second, consuming application.
To achieve this behavior, you need a way to connect the applications on OpenShift to your Kafka instance in {product-kafka}.

In cases such as this, you can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator. The Service Binding Operator automatically provides an application on Kubernetes with the parameters required to connect to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}. This process is called __service binding__.

You can also use the Service Binding Operator to connect the application to a {registry} instance. {registry} instances store value and key schemas (as well as APIs). When you use a schema with your Kafka instance, the schema ensures that messages conform to a specified format.

This guide describes how to perform service binding for {product-kafka} and {registry}. The Kubernetes platform referred to in the remainder of this guide is Red Hat OpenShift.
