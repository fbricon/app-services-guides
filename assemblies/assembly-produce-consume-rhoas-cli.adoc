// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use the Rhoas Cli to create and read message in {product-long-kafka} and third-party systems.

In this example, you will produce messages to a kafka instance and consume them in the Rhoas Cli.

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

== Overview

{product-long-kafka} is a cloud service that simplifies the process of running Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed, publish-subscribe messaging system for creating fault-tolerant, real-time data feeds.

You can use {product-long-connectors} to configure communication between {product-kafka} instances and external services and applications. {product-long-connectors} allow you to configure how data moves from one endpoint to another without writing code.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from a data source through a data source connector to a Kafka topic. And how data flows from a Kafka topic to a data sink through a data sink connector.
